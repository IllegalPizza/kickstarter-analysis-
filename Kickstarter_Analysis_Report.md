# Kickstarter Outcome Analysis for Plays

## Project Overview

### The Purpose of this analysis is to understand trends with Kickstarter campaigns for theatrical plays. This analysis shows the correlations between a campaign’s start dates and targeted goal amount, against the resulting outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    - By comparing the campaign launch months with their resulting outcomes, we were able to see that certain months are much more successful than others. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    - By comparing the campaign goal amounts with their resulting outcomes, we were able to see that the goal amount affected the outcome and that lower goals were met more often. We also see that most campaigns goals for plays are under $5000.00. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    -Errors made earlier in the master work sheet needed to be corrected before completing these final anaylysis. 
    -Excel added a note to most of the "Countifs" data cells created, resulting in a good deal of second-guessing. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    *May and June have the highest rate of successful campaigns, and may be the best time to launch a campaign. December has the lowest rate of successful campaigns, and may be the worst time to launch a campaign.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    *Campaign Goals below $5000.00 have a higher success rate then goals above $5000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    *Additional filtering by country may be helpful to understand if these trends continue for Great Britain. Cultural events or holidays may skew the data for specific countries. 
    *The data seems to be from 2014-2016, and may not represent our current economic situation. Environmental conditions (like a global Pandemic) can greatly affect theatrical performances. In recent years theaters have been closed, which could affect current kickstarter trends.   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    *Furthur filter by country and smaller subsets of data for goal amount may help Louise understand where she should begin her campaign.
